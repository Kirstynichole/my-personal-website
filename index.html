        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Going to school in New York, I’ve had the chance to work with great brands like Birchbox, Amerex Group, and Disney.
            <br>
            <br>
            After graduating I worked for WGACA, a luxury brand reseller, before getting recruited to working in Sourcing at Ann Taylor. During my time there, I was promoted to Associate Manager of Sourcing & Production in 11 months, and I traveled to visit production partners in India and Hong Kong. After 2 years with Ann Taylor I moved  to Charleston, SC to be closer to family.
            <br>
            <br>
            I bought a house in downtown Charleston, SC and spent that last couple of years flipping it (for a profit).
            <br>
            <br>
            Now I’m back in New York combining my problem-solving skills with my eye for creative curation and design by pursuing a long held dream of becoming a software engineer.
